      <p>Considering the first 3 weeks Zume <em>employees</em> were even asking me what the Imagine team does, I will take my chances and bet
        that you don't have much of an idea either. The conversation would go like this. "So what is Imagine? What do you do exactly”? And after
         the tenth time of being asked that question I just say, "everything BUT pizza". WHATTTTT, you're saying you worked at a pizza company
         and didn't even do anything pizza related? If you don't count the excessive amount of pizza I ate for breakfast each day, the answer
         is <em> NO, </em> I did nothing pizza related. Now you are probably asking, so what did you do? </p>

         <p> I spent my days on the Imagine team researching and becoming a pro on any and every topic they gave me. Imagine is a part of Zume Inc.’s
          Ratio Platform that provides companies with any necessary hardware, software, consulting, or technology needed to better their business.
          As for my role, I would be given a company that was seeking to acquire Zume technology, and develop a Company Profile with the summary of
          the company for the rest of the team. </p>
         <p>The ironic part is, research is my least favorite thing to do. Yet, for this STEM girl, after 6 weeks of scanning the internet trying to find a company’s fiscal
          report, research became an easier and more enjoyable task for me. </p>
